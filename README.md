Software-Interview

As part of our application we allow our users to browse by product categories. Once they have selected a particular product category we inform about the sustainability attributes related to that particular product. This can take the form of both relevant practices/criteria sourced from ecolabels/EPPs and ProductBio's own impact areas.

Please build a small search application which allows the user to browse by product category and return relevant data for that particular category. 

Please work in Python, you are free to use whichever web framework you prefer (Django, Flask, etc...)

Database details:

--host=product-data.cuviiwejzyww.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
--port=5432 \
--username=webapp \
--password= \
--dbname=pb_product_data

Please look in the cridata table.

Please commit your work to the interview repo on Github so that we can look at your application locally after the hour has passed.
